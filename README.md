# Project Name

<p>Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945.</p>
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
<ul>
<li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
<li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
<li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
  </ul>
The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
